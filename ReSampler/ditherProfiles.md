## Dithering Profiles used in ReSampler

- Generally, the noise shaping becomes more intense (has higher amplitude) as the Dither Profile ID increases,
with the ID of 0 corresponding to *flat* (no noise shaping; which is also equivalent to using the **--flat-tpdf** switch).

- As the dither profile ID increases, the noise shapes are designed to have progressively less *perceived noise* (despite actually having *more* noise added to the output). 

- The noise source for all dither profiles is TPDF noise (Triangular Probability Density Function).

- Most of these noise-shaping curves are designed for 44.1kHz playback. Curves for other samplerates may be provided in future versions.

- Although the noise-shaping curves are primarily designed for 44.1kHz, you can use any dither profile with any sampling rate, with the result being that the curve will be 'stretched' to scale with the sampling rate, which means that the notches and bumps may no longer be in their optimal positions.
*Nevertheless, for very high sample rates (88.2kHz+), ID 1 or ID 2 work well in practice*

*Final Note: At normal listening levels, the effects of dithering are quite noticeable with 8-bit audio, very subtle with 16-bit, and most likely completely insignificant for 24-bit*
